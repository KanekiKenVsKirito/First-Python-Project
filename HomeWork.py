#! 1. Character Input
#*   Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age.

# your_name = input("Enter your name: ")
# your_age = input("Enter your age: ")
# print(f'Name: {your_name}')
# print(f'Age: {your_age}')

#? =================================================================================================================

#! 2. Odd Or Even
#*    Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

# enter_number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# if enter_number%2 == 0:
#     print(f"It's a EVEN number: {enter_number}")
# else:
#     print(f"It's a Odd number: {enter_number}")

#? =================================================================================================================

#! 3. List Less Than Ten
#*    Take a list, say for example this one:
#*    a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
#*    and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 4, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# for i in a:
#     if i < 5:
#         print(i)

#? =================================================================================================================

#! 4. Divisors
#*    Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.

# num = int(input("Number: "))

# number = []

# for i in range(1, num + 1):
#     if num % i == 0:
#         number.append(i)
# print(f"The number: {num}, and divisors: {number}")

#? =================================================================================================================

#! 5. List Overlap
#*    Take two lists, say for example these two:
#*    a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
#*    b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
#*    and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).

# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 20]
# b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 20]

# result = set()

# for num1 in a:
#     if num1 in b:
#         result.add(num1)
# result = list(result)

# print(result)

#? =================================================================================================================

#! 6. String Lists
#*    Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not.

# string = str(input("Please enter a string: "))
# if string[::-1] == string:
#     print("It's polindrom: ", string)
# else:
#     print("It isn't polindrom: ", string)

#? =================================================================================================================

#! 7. List Comprehensions
#*    Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable:
#*    a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
#*    Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

# number = [32, 12, 142, 211, 232, 443, 22, 12, 53, 23, 43, 45, 43, 33, 32]
# result = []
# for i in number:
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         result.append(i)
# print(result)

## =================================================================================================================

# # 8. Rock Paper Scissors
# #    Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game using input().
# # Define the possible choices
# choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

# # Define the rules of the game
# rules = {
#     "rock": "scissors", # rock beats scissors
#     "paper": "rock", # paper beats rock
#     "scissors": "paper" # scissors beats paper
# }

# # Define a function to get the valid choice from the player
# def get_choice(player):
#     # Ask the player for their choice
#     choice = input(f"Player {player}, enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
#     # Check if the choice is valid
#     while choice not in choices:
#         # If not, ask again
#         print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
#         choice = input(f"Player {player}, enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()
#     # Return the valid choice
#     return choice

# # Define a function to compare the choices and determine the winner
# def compare_choices(choice1, choice2):
#     # If the choices are the same, it is a tie
#     if choice1 == choice2:
#         print("It is a tie.")
#     # If the choice1 beats the choice2, player 1 wins
#     elif rules[choice1] == choice2:
#         print("Player 1 wins.")
#     # Otherwise, player 2 wins
#     else:
#         print("Player 2 wins.")

# # Start the game
# print("Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game!")
# # Get the choices from the players
# choice1 = get_choice(1)
# choice2 = get_choice(2)
# # Compare the choices and announce the winner
# compare_choices(choice1, choice2)
# # End the game
# print("Thank you for playing!")
